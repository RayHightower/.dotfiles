.dotfiles
===

Configuration files used by Ray Hightower. Most of the ideas in these files were borrowed or learned from other developers. Thank you open source community!

Each dotfile in this directory is reached via symlink from its original directory. Details are given in the blog article [Managing Dotfiles](http://rayhightower.com/blog/2014/04/15/managing-dotfiles/).
