.dotfiles
===

Configuration files used by Ray Hightower. Most of the ideas in these
files were borrowed or learned from other developers. Thank you open
source community!

Each dotfile in this directory is reached via symlink from the directory where one would normally look for it. The process is described in the  blog article [Managing Dotfiles]().
